PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR SERVER ISSUE
========================================

PROBLEM: You're getting ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT when trying to access the website.

SOLUTION STEPS:

1. FIRST, FIND YOUR CORRECT IP ADDRESS:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: ipconfig
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" under "Wi-Fi" or "Ethernet"
   - Note down the IP address (it will be something like 192.168.1.17 or 192.168.0.121)

2. START THE SERVER:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Navigate to: cd D:\Marketbrand\marketbrand-marketing-website
   - Run: npm run dev
   - Wait for the server to start (you'll see "Ready" message)

3. ACCESS THE WEBSITE:
   - Use: http://localhost:3000 (for local access)
   - Use: http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000 (for network access)
   - Replace YOUR_IP_ADDRESS with the IP you found in step 1

4. IF STILL NOT WORKING:
   - Kill any existing processes: taskkill /f /im node.exe
   - Clear cache: Remove the .next folder if it exists
   - Restart: npm run dev

WORKING URLS:
- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Network: http://192.168.1.17:3000 (replace with your actual IP)

QUICK FIX BATCH FILES CREATED:
- FIX-SERVER-PERMANENT.bat (Run this to start server with correct IP)
- START-SERVER.ps1 (PowerShell version)
- GET-CORRECT-IP.bat (Shows your current IP address)
